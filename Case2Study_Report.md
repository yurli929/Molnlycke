# Introduction
The study is based on the synthetic dataset comprised of Electronic Health Records (EHR). There are 16 sub datasets, which record the medical history of 1171 patients, such as: demographic data, medications, diagnoses, care plans, lab results, etc.

# Visualize Single Patient
Timeline is important to the patient's medical history. From the timeline, the patients' visiting records with corresponding conditions, care plans, lab observations, etc. can be easily collected and read. In this case, I utilize two approaches to visualize the single patient's medical history. The first way is to print the medical logs.
